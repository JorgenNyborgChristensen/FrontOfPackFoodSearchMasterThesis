          Welcome to our study ‘Recipe Search’! The aim of this study is to
          understand how people search for online recipes and make food
          decisions. This study is part of my master thesis at the University of
          Bergen, NO, under supervision of dr.ir. Alain Starke & dr.ir.
          Christoph Trattner. Before clicking ‘Yes, Accept’ to proceed, please
          carefully read the procedure followed in this study and give your
          informed consent for voluntary participation*. You can stop your
          participation at any time during the study.
        </p>
        <h3>Procedure</h3>
        <p class="informedText">
          You will be asked to search for three different recipes using
          different predefined keywords. Each search will result in a total of
          20 recipes, you will be asked to choose the recipe that you like the
          most, and would like to cook at home. In addition, you will be asked
          to answer a few questions after each recipe you have selected. The
          study does not involve any risks, detrimental side effects, or cause
          discomfort.
        </p>
        <h3>Duration & Compensation</h3>
        <p class="informedText">
          The study takes about 6 minutes to complete. You will be compensated
          with £0.75 for your participation.
